## Features:
 - **RCON Integration:** Seamlessly control your server using RCON commands.
 - **Server Query:** Retrieve real-time information about your server's status, including player count and connection info.
 - **Whitelist Management:** Easily manage your server's whitelist and create a database of players SteamID, PlayUID, and other information for secure access control.
 - **Player Logging:** Keep track of player activity by logging join and leave events on your server.

 ## Experimental Features
 > This is currently broken and not functioning correctly. Filtering doesn't seem to be working with the current API endpoint.
 - **EOS Protocol**: Interact with the Epic Online Services (EOS) API to retrieve detailed information about your server. This is currently experimental and does have some issues.
